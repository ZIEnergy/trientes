To get the project up and running:

1. [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) must be installed (requires [node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed).

2. In the command line, being in the folder with the project, you should execute the command: `yarn`.

3. Then, after installing all the packages:
  - `gulp build` — to just build the project. A public folder will appear in the root of the project, where all compiled ones will be.
  - `gulp dev` — to build the project and run it on the local server. After launching, a page with the built project should automatically open in your browser (usually it is [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)).
